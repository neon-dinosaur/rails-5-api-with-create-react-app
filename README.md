# Sheet Tracker

Sheet Tracker is built using Create-React-App and Rails 5 in API mode.  This application works differently than some other configurations of React and Rails.  After pulling down the code, you can stand up the Node server from `client` folder with `npm start`.  The Rails server can be stood up with the usual `rails s` or `rails server`.  I'll update with more information as my initial configuration continues.  More information about the basic commands that come out of the box with create-react-app can be found in the client directory README.
